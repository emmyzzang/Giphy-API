# Giphy-API
A simple gif loader using the Giphy API, Ajax, JS/JQuery, and frontend tech. 

On click of each button selection at the top, the input keywords are natively appended to query against the API GET call. The callback returns ten gifs that are prepended to a div tag and outputted to the dom.
